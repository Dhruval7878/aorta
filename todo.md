 - ~~certainly there should be option where users will be able to see all of above thing and approve and disapprove~~
make standouts section
 - give option to give caption to each image , which will be optional , and another user can comment something on that when commented like and comment is sent to likes section
 - make some pop up when user taps on their matches section and they see a user , that will be chat section and in chat section at top bar
their name and avatar will be visible like maybe minified avatar and they will have their name over there (the user on whom we tapped from matched section) and when again tapped on avatar then their profile will appear which is visible in feed section as well
 - add media (cloudinary)
 - make proper feed card
 - replce profile menu option with settings and in settings there will be multiple options such as logout , del ac , edit section and view feed page as well
 - in likes section we lets the user that who they likes and who they won't and when tap something else in that card other than those two buttons then that user who likes them their feed card will be opened 
 - first we need to give option to add images and then show it on feed
 - and yes option to edit it as well
 - then on that some more user content is going to be generated
 - YAP(it's written above as well) but ok
 - need to make / page where we could put mock images for visual representation on biggere screens
 - in match thing currently we are showing userId but chng that and keep there time to start new chat when there is no previous message
